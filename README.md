## Android Programming Task

In order to be considered for the Android position, you must complete the following steps. 

*Note: This task should take no longer than 1-2 hours at the most.*



### Prerequisites

- Knowledge of Android and Android Studio.
- Knowledge of Java.
- You will need to have [Java](http://www.java.com/en/download/), [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html), and the [Android SDK](http://d.android.com/sdk/index.html) installed.

## Task

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a *source* folder to contain your code. 
3. In the *source* directory, please create an Android app that accomplishes the following:
	- Get a list of youtube videos grouped into playlists 
http://cscompanion.com/api/test.json
	- Create a list view that shows each of the 
playlists as 
list items.
	- When a playlist item is tapped, the app should drill down and show each item of the 
selected playlist with it's corresponding thumbnail image.
	- When a video item is tapped, the youtube video should begin playing 
immediately. We would prefer that you do not use a web view for this (use a youtube 
library instead).
	- The user should be able to navigate back to the list view after viewing the 
youtube video. 
4. Commit and Push your code to your new repository
5. Send us a pull request, we will review your code and get back to you
